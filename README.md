# UnFUG.org

This repository contains the UnFUG.org page sources.

## Notes for what would be great on the website

We need:

* [x] History of talks already done
* [x] Schedule
* [ ] Entries for each talk, including references, etc.
* [x] About
* [x] ical / calendar entries
* [x] RSS / ATOM Feeds
* [ ] New design (of course)
* [x] Site for special events: { Golfing, Challenges, Trips to CCC, LUGS } -> Blog
* [ ] Source code highlighting
* [ ] The talk-pages should be able to have the slides, which shouldn't be in the
  git repository. How to do this properly?
