I entered the university in 2013, summer semester. I've been a member of the
unfug from the very start of my first semester and I took the leadership of
the unfug in my 4th semester. It was always a pleasure to me to hear talks
with the people at the weekly meetups and although I heard several topics
for like the 3rd time, it never got bored.
