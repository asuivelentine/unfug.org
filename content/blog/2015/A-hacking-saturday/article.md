We had a programming event this saturday where several members of the Unfug
participated in an Event where we programmed together.

The main goal of this event was to do something together, not necessarily
collaborating in one project but creating an atmosphere of creativity and
productivity. For this, we met on a Saturday morning and programmed all day
long. Six members of the Unfug hacked on projects in Python, Viml, Ruby,
Rust and C++, one Notebook got a new Linux installation (it was Arch, Fedora
and as far as I can remember even Debian, I'm not sure which one it is now).

The feedback on this event was positive and several members wanted another
event like this next month. Maybe we can do this again, yes. I'd love to host
another "Unfug-Programming-Saturday"!
