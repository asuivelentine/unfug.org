UnFUCK 2016! It is happening.

UnFUCK is a event organized and held by the UnFUG group. It features several
talks with topics varying from kernel dev to cloud deployment, hacker games, a
lot of Club Mate and social interaction between professors, alumini and
students.

This year we have prepared four days for the event, featuring 18 talks and 3
workshops.

We had a lot of really awesome talks, enough time to socialize during the event
and a few hacker games like Hacker-Jeopardy.

We enjoyed it a lot and I'm really looking forward to the next event.
