For this semester, the Unfug got the permission to host a weekly event, called
the "Unfug Hackt" (unfug programming).

The event will take place on Saturday from 14:00 and is open ended. The basic
idea is for people to work on their programming projects and to collaborate,
socialize and generally have fun together.

However, we are not a tutoring group. While guidance can be offered it is not
something to expect in general. In thoses cases Google is your friend :)

However what is to be expected is a fun environment filled with music,
cheerfulness and laptops.

See you there next time!
