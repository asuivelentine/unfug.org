For this semester, the Unfug got the permission to host a weekly event, called
the "Unfug Hackt" (unfug programming).

The attendees of the Unfug will meet each Saturday (from 14:00, open end) to
work on their private programming projects and to collaborate, socialize and to
have fun together while working with and learning programming languages.

We will not provide tutoring for people which are too stupid to use google.
We are neither a programming-learning class nor a homework group.
We want to work efficient and in a quiet and concentrating
environment on private projects. Collaboration is wanted, but not required.
Discussion and exchange of ideas and opinions is desired.

Lets see how things work out!
